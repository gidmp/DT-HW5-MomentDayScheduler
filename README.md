5th homework for UWMC coding bootcamp

1. use 3 different div for the timeblocks's time, text area(use form/input?) and save button then align them then repeat them for each 1 hour passed

2. assign a same value to the divs in the same line, maybe using prop()???

3. somehow connect the time div to moment JS so the present colored red, past-grey, future-green by compating the current time with past and future time. probably use .set() from momnetJS???

4.when the save button is clicked, save the form/input with the same attr/prop as the button to the local storage and render it, same when you erased the text.
